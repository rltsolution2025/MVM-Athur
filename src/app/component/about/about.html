            <div class="sub-sub-text">
                Knowledge is structured in consciousness means, consciousness constitutes knowledge…
                If we want complete knowledge we should have a state of consciousness which is most comprehensive.
                The expanded and bounded state of the consciousness should be established and then on that basis
                whatever knowledge is gained will be true and complete.

            <div class="sub-title mt-4">School Emblem</div>

                The Emblem of the School is very significant, for it tells the whole story of human life. The tree
                here is the tree of knowledge with varied branches of diversified faculties and the roots denote the
                consciousness, the ultimate source of life “Water the root and enjoy the fruit” – His Holiness
                Maharishi’s Principle.
